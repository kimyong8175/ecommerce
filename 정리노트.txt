errorMiddleware를 만든 이유:
But the express default error handler returns an error in the HTML page. 
To fix this, I'll add an error middleware in my app.

Mongoose returns a promise in response
For async/await we have to use a try/catch method but as I already have an error handler so I'll use express-async-handler package.
This package will handle the exceptions inside of async express routes and pass them to my express error handlers.

select() => select() is a method of Mongoose that is used to select document fields that are to be returned in the query result. 
It is used to include or exclude document fields that are returned from a Mongoose query. 
The select() method performs what is called query projection.


ex) select("-password") => exclude password
ex) select("name email") => returns only name and email fields
