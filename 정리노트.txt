errorMiddleware를 만든 이유:
But the express default error handler returns an error in the HTML page. 
To fix this, I'll add an error middleware in my app.

Mongoose returns a promise in response
For async/await we have to use a try/catch method but as I already have an error handler so I'll use express-async-handler package.
This package will handle the exceptions inside of async express routes and pass them to my express error handlers.
